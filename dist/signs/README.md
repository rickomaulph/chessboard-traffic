# Traffic Sign Images

This directory contains the traffic sign images used in the game.

For a production version, you'll need to provide images for each traffic sign referenced in the `trafficSigns.ts` data file. Each image should be named according to its ID, for example:
- stop.png
- no-entry.png
- curve-right.png

For testing purposes during development, the game will fallback to placeholder images when the actual sign images are not found.
